			<h3 class="author">AdamElTablawy updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Changeling chemical glands have increased their viability, vastly improving the utility of changeling stings. In particular, Nanotrasen crews should be aware that 'mute sting' now injects mute toxin, and the 'transform sting' no longer damages changeling genomes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Changelings have successfully fought-off the NT retrovirus bioweapon that forced them to change their single-target hallucination stings into mass-ending plagues of hallucinations, likely because NT realized this was a horrible idea, and the hallucination sting is now a single-target, low cost sting once again.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">The revive dead rune has been changed. Now, each sacrifice will 'charge' it. If the number of sacrifice charges is greater than the number of cultists revived by any of the runes, a cultist can be placed on the rune to be revived.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The sacrifice and convert runes have been placed by the 'offer' rune, which fulfills the purpose of both. 2 cultists will convert. 3 cultists will sacrifice a living target. If a target cannot be converted the rune will sacrifice them.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The void torch has been added. This item, attainable through archives, can be used to warp items to other cultists.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The flagellant robes now convey a 50% increase in damage taken instead of a 100% increase in damage taken. They still provide the same speed boost. Which is massive. Use them.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The cult sword can now block incoming projectiles or melee hits, and can be thrown to embed. If this is too powerful it will be changed or reverted accordingly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Veil shifter now has 4 charges, up from 2.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All constructs except for the wraith are about the same speed as a human, or slower. The artificer in particular is slower. Wraiths are far more fragile than before. Harvesters, spawned by nar'sie, are much much much stronger.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">As usual, if you have any questions or complaints ping me and i'll respond.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The ash drake blood potion has been nerfed. Again. Also, all of the other ash drake drops are removed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">More alien simplemob fixes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can't get holoparasites from fucking xenobiology anymore (what)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">ShadowDeath6 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscdel">Blood and clockwork cultists can no longer scribe runes or create structures off of the station's z level.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Tinkerer's cache turns itself off when leaving the zlevel or being in space. It has a new icon to indicate when this happens.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixes invisible judicial visor icons. Wait, that was SUPPOSED to be visible?</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the lag. Cause of lag, IT'S THE GOD DAMN ACTION ICONS. Now, name off a few things you'd expect to cause lag: Atmos, large amounts of space carp, maybe having to process breathing and shit, maybe a loose singularity, but no. It's just action icons being ridiculously inefficient as fuck for literally no reason. This fix basically makes them not update their overlays every single tick.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">13 new ruins, most replacing old outdated ruins.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">around 10 new ghost roles, replacing a few old ones.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">A lot of the old ruins that we've had since we ported lavaland are gone and have been replaced with the newer ones.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cosmic Ashwalker now spawns in one of the new ruins, a very hardcore role similar to that of the hermite.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The travelling bard now spawns on Lavaland and is expected to make his way to the station in hopes of entertaining the crew with his epic tales and songs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Syndicate now have a Xenomorph testing facility on Lavaland, the purpose of this is to tutor players on the dangers of xenos while also giving players the chance to play as the xenos and learn how they work. This should hopefully make more players accustomed to xeno rounds when they occur.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Clown Biodome now has more clown related loot.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">There are 4 new mob themed ruins, a Weaver nest, Goliath Mound, Watcher Spiral and a Legion Barracks, each with their own basic theme and loot to plunder.  These are difficult ruins to raid and only experienced miners should attempt them.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Animal Hospital ruin has been reworked into the Orion Medical Outpost, it now functions as a medical tutorial ruin and also spawns with an Orion Space Security Officer to protect it from walkers and mobs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ported the Syndicate recon outpost from tg which will allow players to experiment with making deadly diseases and chemical concoctions. The ruin also has its own radio setup so the communications officer can work with syndies and elude the crew of the station.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Space Bar will no longer mimic teleporter beacons and players can now exit its z-level since it uses a teleporter now</li>
